Girinoscope
===========

A simple graphical user interface for
[Girino, a Fast Arduino Oscilloscope](http://www.instructables.com/id/Girino-Fast-Arduino-Oscilloscope/).
The screen captures below display the acquisition of various signals generated by another DIY project:
[Skill Builder: Advanced Arduino Sound Synthesis](http://makezine.com/projects/make-35/advanced-arduino-sound-synthesis/).

Since this little application is intimately bound to Girino,
the various settings provided by Girinoscope are not detailled here.
If you have already built your own Girino and studied the firmware,
they should be pretty easy to understand.

**Warning**
The Arduino code provided in the [Girino Instructable]
(http://www.instructables.com/id/Girino-Fast-Arduino-Oscilloscope/).
doesn't handle very well 'the wait duration' parameter that you can set using the vertical green rule.
There are a small bug when changing the value through the serial interface
and some strange behaviors which can very well originate from the way I've built my Girino.

Girino.h, line 41: replace 3 by 4 since the wait duration range is [0, 1280[.

<code>
    #define COMBUFFERSIZE   3   // Size of buffer for incoming numbers
</code>

Girino.ino, line 229: replace 'uint8' by 'uint16' for the same reason.

<code>
    uint8_t newT = atoi( commandBuffer );
</code>

Build
-----

There are no binary package for the Girinoscope at this time, so you will need to build it yourself.
You just need a [JDK 1.6 or higher](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
and [Ant](http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi).
Nothing particular exotic in the Java world.
Once installed, a simple `ant dist` in the `build` folder will do the job
and produce a distribution archive for your platform in the `target` folder.

Install
-------

Girinoscope uses the same native library than Arduino IDE 1.0.5 to manage serial port: the RxTx library.
It is not necessarily the perfect solution
and the latest Arduino IDE version (1.5.7 BETA) has droped it in favor of something more elaborate.
Whatever, the RxTx works well enough for Girinoscope and, if you have already successfuly installed the Arduino IDE,
it should work out of the box.
Otherwise, there is all the informations you need on the [Arduino site](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage).
Since Girinoscope is a Java application and doesn't embed its own JRE,
you also need to install Java 1.6 or later on your machine.
